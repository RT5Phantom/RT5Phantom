# Hello World!
My name is @RT5Phantom! I'm a Software Developer who enjoys working with all kinds of technology. I know several technology languages, frameworks, and structures, including C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, ASP.net, Springboot, MySQL, and MongoDB.

I have a lot of projects that I build, some are on GitHub and some are not. On top of that only a few of my projects on GitHub are publicly viewable. This is mostly because I only switch my repositories to public that I think are well-made and useful enough for others to use.
